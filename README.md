## 📌 Overview
Roles is a command-line utility designed to help you identify your key roles in life (such as student, parent, creator, or friend) and structure your day around fulfilling the responsibilities tied to those roles. Instead of organizing tasks by arbitrary goals or to-do lists, Roles helps you focus on what truly matters by aligning your daily actions with your core identities and commitments.
